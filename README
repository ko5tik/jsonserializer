JSON Serializer is small and lightweight library to marshall
POJOs to JSON strings intended to use in android applications.

Core features:
  - small and lightweight
  - minimal external dependencies ( only GSON pull parser )
  - no metadata (use reflection)
  - simple to use

Current state:
  - marshalls complete POJO trees
  - understands arrays og POJO and primitives (even multidimensional)
  - unmarshalls POJO trees,  with arrays of POJOS or primitives 
  - no collection support yet due to lack of idea  how to determine 
    object type from  JSON
  - snapshots are deployed to sonatype OSS repository ( https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/ )
  - releases are pushed to maven central
