JSON Serializer is small and lightweight library to marshall
POJOs to JSON strings intended to use in android applications.

Core features:
  - small and lightweight
  - no external dependecies (from android point of view)
  - no metadata (use reflection)
  - simple to use

Current state:
  - marshalls complete POJO trees
  - unmarshalls POJOs with just primitives
  - just enough for implementing highscore storage fo my android game (market://search?q=pname:de.pribluda.games.android.lines)
